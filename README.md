LeetCode Solutions and Data Structures Practice
This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, focusing on improving data structures and algorithms skills.

Getting Started
This repository is designed to be a reference and a learning tool. Feel free to explore the solutions, but it's recommended to:

Attempt problems on your own first. LeetCode is most beneficial when you wrestle with the problem and develop your own solution.
Use these solutions as a reference after you've tried your best. See how others approached the problem and learn alternative solutions.
Don't simply copy solutions. The goal is to understand the concepts and improve your problem-solving abilities.
Directory Structure
The code is organized by LeetCode problem number within folders. Each folder may contain:

solution.py (or .cpp, .java, etc.): The solution code in your preferred language.
explanation.md (optional): An explanation of the solution approach and any key concepts used.
Contributing
While this repository is primarily for my own practice, feel free to reach out if you have improvements or alternative solutions for specific problems. You can create a pull request with your contribution.
